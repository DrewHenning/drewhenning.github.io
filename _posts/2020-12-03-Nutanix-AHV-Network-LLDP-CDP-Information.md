Nutanix AHV is able to receive Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) from the upstream switches they are connected to.

To receive LLDP/CDP information can run lldpctl from an AHV host. If youâ€™d like to pull the information from all nodes in a cluster, SSH into a Nutanix CVM and run:

```bash
hostssh lldpctl
```
All good
