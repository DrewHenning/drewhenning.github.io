To receive LLDP/CDP information can run lldpctl from an AHV host. If you’d like to pull the information from all nodes in a cluster, SSH into a Nutanix CVM and run: hostssh lldpctl This is a great way to see details on what switch ports yo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to upgrade Splunk on CentOS7</title><link href="https://drewhenning.com/posts/How-to-upgrade-Splunk-on-CentOS7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to upgrade Splunk on CentOS7" /><published>2020-10-11T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-07-05T20:41:58-05:00</updated> <id>https://drewhenning.com/posts/How-to-upgrade-Splunk-on-CentOS7/</id> <content src="https://drewhenning.com/posts/How-to-upgrade-Splunk-on-CentOS7/" /> <author> <name>Drew Henning</name> </author> <category term="Splunk" /> <summary> I needed to upgrade a small Splunk server from 7.1.2 to 7.3.2 on a CentOS7. Overall the process was fairly straightforward, below were my steps. When in doubt, follow the official documentation from Splunk. Download the new version of Splunk Grab the .tgz file for Splunk Enterprise – https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html#tabs/linux In this case the file name was: splunk... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Determine if Hyper-Threading is Enabled on a Nutanix AHV Host</title><link href="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Determine-if-Hyper-Threading-is-Enabled-on-Nutanix-AHV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Determine if Hyper-Threading is Enabled on a Nutanix AHV Host" /><published>2020-10-01T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2020-10-01T18:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://drewhenning.com/posts/Determine-if-Hyper-Threading-is-Enabled-on-Nutanix-AHV/</id> <content src="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Determine-if-Hyper-Threading-is-Enabled-on-Nutanix-AHV/" /> <author> <name>Drew Henning</name> </author> <category term="Nutanix" /> <summary> I had a customer ask if Hyper-Threading (HT) was enabled on their Nutanix AHV host. As of AOS 5.18 (Oct 2020) the HT status is not visible in Prism. You only see the actual cores on the host. To get the HT status, you have to jump into the CLI. SSH into a Nutanix CVM and run: hostssh "lscpu | egrep '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('" The hostssh macro will run the following command on all hyp... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Nutanix Network Bandwidth Test</title><link href="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Nutanix-Network-Bandwidth-Test/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nutanix Network Bandwidth Test" /><published>2019-01-26T17:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-07-05T20:44:53-05:00</updated> <id>https://drewhenning.com/posts/Nutanix-Network-Bandwidth-Test/</id> <content src="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Nutanix-Network-Bandwidth-Test/" /> <author> <name>Drew Henning</name> </author> <category term="Nutanix" /> <summary> Here’s a quick script to check the network bandwidth/throughput on a Nutanix cluster. SSH into a Nutanix CVM and run: allssh ./diagnostics/diagnostics.py run_iperf This will loop through each CVM and test network performance to the other CVM’s in the cluster. It leverages the diagnostics.py script that is builtin to each CVM. Use caution when executing this script as iPerf is designed to pu... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Test Network Ports on Nutanix CVMs</title><link href="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Test-Network-Ports-on-Nutanix-CVMs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Test Network Ports on Nutanix CVMs" /><published>2018-12-12T17:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-07-05T20:44:53-05:00</updated> <id>https://drewhenning.com/posts/Test-Network-Ports-on-Nutanix-CVMs/</id> <content src="https://drewhenning.com/posts/Test-Network-Ports-on-Nutanix-CVMs/" /> <author> <name>Drew Henning</name> </author> <category term="Nutanix" /> <summary> Every now and then you’ll need to test connectivity on Nutanix CVM’s. For example, if you are setting up replication on Nutanix you’ll need TCP port 2020 open between the clusters. In Windows I would test this using telnet but since the Nutanix CVM’s are based on linux we need to use the netcat (nc) command. For example, if I wanted to test TCP port 2020 between clusters, I would SSH into a C... </summary> </entry> </feed>
